This Python script empties the Trash folder on macOS by executing the shell command rm -rf ~/.Trash/*. It uses os.system() to run the command that recursively deletes all files in the Trash without any confirmation. The script includes error handling to catch potential issues (like permission errors) and prints success or error messages. Be cautious using this script as it permanently deletes files from the Trash without any opportunity to recover them.
