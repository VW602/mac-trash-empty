The script provided is for emptying the Trash folder on a Mac using Python.
It calls a shell command (rm -rf ~/.Trash/*) to remove all files and directories in the Trash. 
The os.system() function is used to execute this command. If the operation is successful, it prints a confirmation message. 
If there is an error (e.g., due to permission issues), it catches the exception and displays an error message.
Be careful when using rm -rf, as it permanently deletes files without confirmation.
